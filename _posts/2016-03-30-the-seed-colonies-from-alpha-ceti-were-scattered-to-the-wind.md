description: 'The seed colonies from Alpha Ceti were scattered to the winds. Many perished after decades in outer space. 127 years after launch, one seed colony ship met with calamity, crashing on a remote, desert planet. Some of the colonists were thawed to salvage what they could, and prepare for rescue, some 78 years hence.'

Many perished after decades in outer space. 127 years after launch, one seed colony ship met with calamity, crashing on a remote, desert planet. Some of the colonists were thawed to salvage what they could, and prepare for rescue, some 78 years hence.
